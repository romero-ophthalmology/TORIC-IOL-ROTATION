# TORIC-IOL-ROTATION

In this repository you will find the python script of to analyse toric IOL rotation. 

To ease the utilization of this software, a GUI version was developed. This version can be downloaded for free at: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2f935chdnu8wmb052ijkt/Toric-Spinner.zip?rlkey=t1dbn4pmbrx987pn3seyao252&dl=0

After downloading the .zip file, uncompress it. Then open "Toric-spinner.exe", enter the IOL position, IOL cylinder at corneal plane and patient's refraction data and press "Calculate". A graph will be displayed indicating the best position to rotate the toric IOL.

If you want to perform several calculations at once, go to \dist\Toric-rotation and edit the "input_database.xlsx" file and save it. After that, open again Toric-spinner.exe and click "Calculate from Excel"
